# Nobel Prize Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Nobel Prize winners using data cleaning, filtering, and dynamic visualizations to uncover patterns and trends. The dataset includes various details about Nobel laureates, and the analysis aims to provide insights into gender, age group, country-wise distribution, and award categories.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze Nobel Prize winners by **gender**, **age group**, and **category**.
- Examine the **country-wise distribution** of prizes to identify patterns.
- Track **trends over time** in different award categories.
- Develop **dynamic visualizations** to explore insights based on the data.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Filtering**: Processed the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency for meaningful analysis.
- **Gender & Age Group Analysis**: Investigated how gender and age impact the likelihood of winning in specific categories.
- **Country-Wise Distribution**: Mapped out the distribution of Nobel laureates by country to highlight regions with the highest number of awards.
- **Category Trends Over Time**: Analyzed the frequency of awards in different categories and how they've changed over the years.
- **Visualizations**: Created interactive charts and graphs to help visualize the distribution patterns and provide deeper insights into gender and category-based trends.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Used for data processing and analysis (libraries like Pandas, Numpy).
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: To create informative and dynamic visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documentation and step-by-step analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive look into the distribution of Nobel Prizes, revealing patterns in gender, age, and category preferences. The dynamic visualizations enabled a clearer understanding of the trends across different countries and prize categories.
